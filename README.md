# EdgeDetector
This is an assignment I did for my Into to Image Understanding class at UofT.  This code uses a homography to match features of two different images of the same thing.

Please make sure opencv is installed before running this program - you can
run the following command to do this: pip install opencv-python

To see the final edge-mapped version of the two images in this repo (puppies.jpg and tower.jpg), please run question6part4.py.

To see a visualization of each step, please run each  file individually.
